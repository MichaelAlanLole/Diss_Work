    <p class="description">Transport-related air pollution is a growing environmental and public health concern,
      especially in urban areas. Emissions from vehicles release harmful pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NOâ‚‚),
      particulate matter (PM), and carbon monoxide (CO) into the atmosphere. These pollutants not only degrade air
      quality but also pose serious health risks, including respiratory issues, cardiovascular diseases, and reduced
      life expectancy.</p>
